LateX tables were generated using https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ and saved as a TGN file for any future editing. Tables can be viewed by loading the TGN files back using the "Load table" option from the menu on the website.

- `MUP-1-acceptance-per-replicate-simulation.tgn`: Acceptance ratios of the replicate simulations at different NCMC step amounts for the MUP-1 system.

- `MUP-1-acceptance-and-force-evaluation-allNCMC-table.tgn`: Here is the average acceptance rate of all BLUES moves and average number of force evaluations across replicates for the buried cavity in MUP-1 system to become hydrated.

- `HSP90-acceptance-per-replicate-simulation.tgn`: Acceptance ratios of all attempted moves for each replicate simulation of the HSP90 protein-ligand system.

- `HSP90-acceptance-FE-WC-table.tgn`: The average acceptance rate of all BLUES moves, the average number of force evaluations across 4 replicates for the buried cavity in the HSP90 system to become hydrated, and the average wallclock time in hours for BLUES to hydrate HSP90.

- `mup1-ncmc-variation-trials.csv`: Accepted BLUES iterations across 10-12 replicate simulations for various NCMC values in `.csv` file format.
