LateX tables were generated using https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ and saved as a TGN file for any future editing. Tables can be viewed by loading the TGN files back using the "Load table" option from the menu on the website.

- `MUP-1-acceptance-per-replicate-simulation.tgn`: Acceptance ratios of the replicate simulations at different NCMC step amounts for the MUP-1 system.

- `MUP-1-acceptance-and-force-evaluation-table.tgn`: Here is the average acceptance rate of all moves and average number of force evaluations across replicates for the buried cavity in MUP-1 system to become hydrated.

- `HSP90-acceptance-per-replicate-simulation.tgn`: Acceptance ratios of all attempted moves for each replicate simulation of the HSP90 protein-ligand system.

- `mup1-ncmc-variation-trials.csv`: Data for this [plot](/Figures/mup-acceptance-ratio-plot.pdf) in the paper (which shows the rate of water transfer from bulk to the internal hydration site in MUP-1 versus increase in NCMC steps). The `.csv` file here contains the accepted BLUES iterations across 10-12 replicate simulations, for various NCMC values.
