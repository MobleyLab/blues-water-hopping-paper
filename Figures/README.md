- `water-scaled-arrow.pdf`: Image depicting molecular interactions between atoms being turned off and on during an NCMC translational water move. `water-scaled.pdf` is the same image, but without an arrow indicating water movement. Made in keynote.

- `3system-crystal-water-circled.png` and `3system-crystal-water-circled.jpg`: Image of three of the systems used to test the ability of NCMC/MD water hopping to allow the exchange of water. The crystallographic water molecules are circled. Individual system images were generated with UCSF Chimera and the final image was made with Inkscape.

- `radius-example-figure.png`: Image depicting a user-defined radius that covers a particular area of interest.

- `mup-acceptance-ratio-plot.pdf`: Plot showing the rate of water transfer from bulk to the internal hydration site in MUP-1 versus increase in NCMC steps. The plot was generated with Matplotlib.

- `graphene-wall-plot-fig-iter.pdf`: Figure showing the water box system with dividing graphene sheets and the densities in the two regions stabilizing over time. The plot was generated with Matplotlib, the image of the system was generated with UCSF Chimera and the final image was made with Inkscape. Figure is in `.pdf` and `.svg` format. `graphene-wall-plot-fig-iter.svg` is Inkscape compatible.

- `blues-cycle.pdf`: Image depicting the workflow of BLUES water hopping proposals. Made in keynote.
